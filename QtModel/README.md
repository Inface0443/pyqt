# QtModel C# Library

This directory contains a partial C# port of the Python-based `qtmodel` package. The project targets .NET 6.0
and can be built into a DLL using the .NET SDK:

```bash
dotnet build
```

The C# project currently includes the core data entities, helper utilities, result objects, server communication
helpers, and the project management facade.
